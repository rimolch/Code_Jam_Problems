# Solutions to problems of Code Jam 2022

This repository includes my solutions to the problems of the Google Code Jam
competitions up to year 2022, either as submitted during the contest or made on a second thought.

Let's begin with briefly outlining the structure of the contest followed by discussing the topics emphasized in these rounds to get a sense about its difficulty.

The competition is held once every year and spans for over 5 months.

According to the data of 2019, the rounds are

1) Qualification Round: Around 35500 people made atleast one attempt in this contest. The cutoff score for this round was 30 which was secured by 27500 people.

This means success percentage is -> (27500/35500) ~ 75 percent

2) Round 1: There are 3 parts to this round A, B, C. You can take part in any of these rounds but if you qualify in any one you can't take part in any other SUB ROUND of round 1. Say you took part in 1A, but didn't qualify, you can still take part in 1B. But if you clear it you can't participate in 1C. You need to be in top 1500 participants in any of these subrounds to make it to round 2.

This means a total of 4500 people qualify round 1.

Success percentage is -> (4500/27500) ~ 16 percent

3) Round 2: Top 1000 of the 4500 people qualify in this round and it is these 1000 people who win t-shirts.

Success percentage -> (1000/4500) ~ 22 percent

4) Round 3: Top 25 people of the 1000 people qualify this round to advance to the world finals.

That broadly said, means 1000 out of 35500 people get code jam t-shirts ~ 2.8 percent

The most important topics you definitely need to master to secure a t-shirt are:

Math, Dynamic Programming, Graphs.

Almost all the problems asked are a combinations of these topics with varied difficulty levels.

Therefore itâ€™s not easy to get one of these and you need to have a fairly good understanding of data structures and algorithms, but nevertheless:


Since google merchandise is cool, adding the pictures of t-shirt I got in 2019 code jamðŸ˜ƒ
